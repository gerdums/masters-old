  for nearly two decades in academia and in research and development. His contributions
  have appeared in several contexts, from international conferences to the U.S. Patent

  his arrival at TMU, and served for a number of years as Chief Judge for Singapore's
  National Software Competition. His research interests include computer graphics,
  multidimensional visualization, computational geometry, and virtual reality. He

  through the years, serving in such capacities as choir conductor, choir member,
  organist, and worship leader. He has "made a joyful noise" in many settings, from
  soup kitchens and prisons to international choral concerts and competitions, as
  well as musical theatre, radio, and television. His other interests include reading,
  photography, the outdoors, swimming, and bowling. He and his wife Mabel are blessed
  with two very huggable children.
